		<p class="text-center">Here are a few of his greatest quotes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>In this age of specialization men who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent to discuss another. The great problems of the relations between one and another aspect of human activity have for this reason been discussed less and less in public.</strong> When we look at the past great debates on these subjects we feel jealous of those times, we should have liked the excitement of such argument. <strong>The old problems, such as the relation of science and religion, are still with us, and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever, but they are not often publicly discussed because of the limitations of specialization</strong></li>
			<li>Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientific spirit of adventure &#8211; the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; <strong>the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it &#8211; the humility of the intellect.</strong> The other great heritage is Christian ethics &#8211; <strong>the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual &#8211; the humility of the spirit.</strong>
			These two heritages are logically, thoroughly consistent. But logic is not all; one needs one's heart to follow an idea. If people are going back to religion, what are they going back to? Is the modern church a place to give comfort to a man who doubts God &#8211; more, one who disbelieves in God? Is the modern church a place to give comfort and encouragement to the value of such doubts? So far, have we not drawn strength and comfort to maintain the one or the other of these consistent heritages in a way which attacks the values of the other? Is this unavoidable? <strong>How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem of our time?</strong></li>
			<li>It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil &#8211; which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.</li>
			<li>Hell, if I could explain it to the average person, it wouldn't have been worth the Nobel prize.</li>
			<li>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself &#8211; and you are the easiest person to fool.</li>
			<li>We are not to tell nature what she&#39;s gotta be &#133; She&#39;s always got better imagination than we have.</li>
			<li>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</li>
			<li>[I call myself] an atheist. Agnostic for me would be trying to weasel out and sound a little nicer than I am about this.</li>
			<li>Einstein was a giant. His head was in the clouds, but his feet were on the ground. But those of us who are not that tall have to choose!</li>
			<li>I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy &#8211; and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he will sound as naive as anyone untrained in the matter.</li>
			<li>The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.</li>
